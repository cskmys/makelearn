Make is a build system that is used to compile C/C++ programs.
It allows us to have various useful features such as recompiling only what is changed, executing instructions, conditionally compiling something etc.

This tutorial compatible version 3 and 4 of `Make`.

You can get `make` from `apt`.

== Makefile syntax
A `Makefile` has a set of rules which look like:

[source,make]
----
targets: prerequisites
    command
    ...
    command
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
`Makefile` must be tab-indented and not spaces
====

* `targets` are filenames, seperated by spaces.
Normally, there's one per rule.
* `command`(s) are series of steps used to make the targets from the pre-requisites.
They need to be tab-indented(not space).
* `prerequisites` are filenames, seperated by spaces, which need to exist in order for the commands to be run.
They are also called `dependencies`.
